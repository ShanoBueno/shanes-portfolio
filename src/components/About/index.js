      <p>Welcome to Shane's Brain, my fullstack engineering portfolio built using React. For the past two years I have 
        been learning fullstack software engineering with the goal of becoming a Jr. Software Developer. In my portfolio you'll find 
        different projects using a multitude of languages. From a fullstack Blog application, to utilities for developers using Inquirer, 
        you'll find I have acquired a plethora software engineering techniques. I am extremely excited
        to become a part of the technological revolution we are experiencing.
